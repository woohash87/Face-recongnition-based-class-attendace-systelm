# Face-recongnition-based-class-attendace-systelm
This project is a real-time face recognition-based class attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. It leverages computer vision to detect and recognize student faces through a webcam and logs their attendance into a CSV file.
 Key Features
 Real-time face detection using webcam
 Face recognition from a preloaded student dataset
 Auto-attendance logging with timestamp (date + time)
Google Drive integration for image storage (Colab-friendly)
 CSV-based attendance record generation
 Fast and efficient using face encodings

Tech Stack
Python (Colab)
OpenCV
face_recognition (Dlib-based)
NumPy
Google Colab & Drive
CSV (for attendance logs)
